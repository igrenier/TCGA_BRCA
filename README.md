# TCGA_BRCA

We wish to understand the factors associated with patient survival in the TCGA-BRCA dataset. We initially want to understand any relation between age, gender, ethnicity, disease stage, year of diagnosis, and 5-year patient survival. Develop a statistical model (or multiple models) to help us predict 5-year survival using the predictors given. Are your models reliable? Are they likely to generalize beyond the given dataset, and to what extent?

Further, we wish to understand which genes are most associated with patient survival. Which would you prioritize for further investigation? Why? How robust are your findings?

For simplicity, data can be found at https://az.box.com/v/qds-interview-data
